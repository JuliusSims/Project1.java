Calorie Tracker:
A calorie counter is a project to count calories and other essential details of a user's diet.

Motivation:
Taking a nutrition class and being curious about the nutrition facts of different foods was a big motivator for this project.

Installation: 
Used eclipse to build the software, coded in Java, to install the software you only need Java and to download and execute the file of the project.

Usage:
We used HashMap to hold the values of each food and calorie item together to log it; then, we used the HashMap feature to push out information for the user to see what they ate and what calories their meal had. 
String food = foodTextField.getText().toLowerCase(): This takes the user input to get information for the program to work.
Calories = Integer.parseInt(calorieTextField.getText()); This takes calorie value as well to take the information from the user as well
JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(this, "You have exceeded your calorie limit"); This message panel tells the user they have exceeded their calorie limit.
